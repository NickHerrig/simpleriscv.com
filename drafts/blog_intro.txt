Have you ever wondered how a computer works? How is it that I'm able to type a few characters, and all of my questions can be answered in milliseconds? Better yet, how is it that I'm able to instantly send messages, emails, and even video chat with people around the world? The answer is surprisingly simple! It certainly surprised me when I found out that all operations I performed via my mobile phone or laptop were condensed to a series of ones and zeros that my hardware understands. These ones and zeros, also known as bits, are the smallest unit of data that your computer understands. Your computer understands bits because it has a brain, usually a central processing unit (CPU), that interprets bits. Similar to you and I speaking the English language together, every CPU has a language that allows it to communicate between software and hardware. This language is known as a Instruction Set Architecture or ISA for short. My favorite analogy is that the CPU is the brain of the computer, and the ISA is the language in which the brain communicates with the world around it.

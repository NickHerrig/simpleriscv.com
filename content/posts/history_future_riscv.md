In the late 80s, the open-source software movement launched with the release of GNU, and since then has enabled a variety of innovative and industry changing software projects. Collaboration between open-source developers across the world enabled speed and new ideas that helped shape the technologies and programming languages we use Today. Although strides have been made with open software, open hardware on the other hand is less common. But this will change in the near future...

## Historically Speaking...
many of the popular ISAs used around the world are proprietary and owned and controlled by a handful of companies. If you had an idea for a new phone, gaming system, or device you would need to license one of these popular ISAs from companies like Intel or ARM. It's as if in order for us to speak Spanish together, we must first pay Intel or ARM a royalty, and then we are able to talk about what we had for breakfast. Something interesting is happening in the ISA space though... 

## The Open ISA
Thanks to the work of some brilliant minds at University of California, Berkeley something interesting is happening in the ISA space. Krste AsanoviÄ‡ along with two graduate students Yunsup Lee and Andrew Waterman started the RISC-V instruction set, an open ISA based on established reduced instruction set computer principles. Shortly after, the RISC-V Foundation was founded to direct the future development of the RISC-V ISA.  Since it's inception, a plethora of technology companies have taken notice. Google, Alibaba, Samsung, Nvidia, and even Raspberry Pi  are just a few that have taken an interest through becoming [members](https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/) of the RISC-V foundation. And more companies continue to become involved. But why have companies shown such an interest in an open ISA and why should you care?

## You should care about this because...
RISC-V will enable the next wave of technology innovation across a multitude of industries. Imagine for a second that the year is 1991, and you just downloaded this new, free, and open sourced operating system called linux. Would you start learning and building application with it knowing what it's become over the years. RISC-V is to hardware innovation, what linux was to software innovation. The future of RISC-V will enable the next wave of device innovation, specialized hardware, and an re imagined software stack. This is pretty impressive timing as [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) is coming to an end. Not only will entrepreneurs and new companies benefit from the RISC-V ISA, but existing companies will be looking for talent to help mold the future of device innovation and custom hardware. That's where you come in...

## That's where you come in...
Whether you're an Entrepreneur wanting to capitalize on the disruption RISC-V will bring. Or whether you're Software Engineer looking to learn the ISA to be a more competitive candidate in interviews. The timing could not be better to start learning about RISC-V. That's where we come into play. 

## Who we are...
Simple RISC-V was founded with the goal to enable people of all skill levels to learn the RISC-V ISA. We accomplish this through a variety of blogs, tutorials, classes, and other content. Our mission is to grow a community of builders, hackers, and craftsmen. With RISC-V at the core this community will build and influence the future of devices and software.

# Who We Are
Simple RISC-V was created in 2020 by a couple of Software Engineers in Des Moines, Iowa interested in building with and learning about RISC-V.
After hearing about the open ISA through [Ren√© Rebe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE-FeFWG28w) and his YouTube channel, we quickly realized what RISC-V would enable in the hands of builders, hackers, developers, entrepreneurs, and engineers.
While attempting to learn about RISC-V though, we quickly wished that there were more simple tutorials, blogs, and tools available for mastering RISC-V.
Fast forward to Today, we are publishing that content in hopes of enabling a community of builders who will drive innovation in hardware never before seen.

# What We Believe
We believe in open collaboration and community.
We believe in helping each other grow, innovate, learn, each and every day.
Above all, we believe in solving important problems with [simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) solutions.

# Our Values

 - Understanding
 - Simplicity
 - Experimentation
 - Question Everything

# Our Mission and Goal for Simple RISC-V
The RISC-V ISA will enable the future of open hardware collaboration and innovation.
Simple RISC-V is helping build an ecosystem around RISC-V where people around the world come to learn, build, play, and share.
We hope to inspire the new era of hardware innovation through the creation of simple tools, tutorials, learning paths, and community building.

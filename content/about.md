# Who We Are
Simple RISC-V was created in 2020 by a couple of softare engineers in Des Moines, Iowa interested in building with and learning about RISC-V.
After hearing about the open ISA through [Ren√© Rebe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE-FeFWG28w) and his youtube chanel, we quickly realized what RISC-V would enable in the hands of builders, hackers, developers, entreprenuers, and engineers. 
While learning about RISC-V though, we wished that there were more simple tutorials, blogs, and tools available for mastering RISC-V. 
Fast forward to Today, we are publishing that content in hopes of building a community of builders who will enable innovation in hardware never before seen.
 
# What We Believe
We believe in open collaboration and community.
We believe in helping eachother grow, innovate, learn, each and every day. 
We believe in building wealth in the world and having [less meetings](https://shoulditbeameeting.com/#/). 
We believe in [getting shit done](https://www.gyshido.com/) and helping those around us.
Above all, we blieve in solving important problems with [simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) solutions.

# The Goal of Simple RISC-V
The RISC-V ISA will enable the future of open hardware collaboration and innovation.
Simple RISC-V is helping build an ecosystem around RISC-V where people around the world come to learn, build, play, and share.
We hope to inspire the new era of hardware innovation through the creation of simple tools, tutorials, learning paths, and community building.
